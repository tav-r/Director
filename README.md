# Director
Burp plugin that helps finding insecure redirects.

## Functionality
Currently the plugin only implements a passive scanner that looks for "suspicious" URL parameters. In the future, I will most likely add some more features like
- Suggesting filter bypasses
- Send probes/fuzzing parameters
- Scan JavaScript files
